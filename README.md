# Nekotatsu Mobile

GUI frontend for [nekotatsu](https://github.com/PhantomShift/nekotatsu),
a tool for converting Tachiyomi backups into backups readable by [Kotatsu](https://github.com/KotatsuApp/Kotatsu).

I am aware that the UI is *incredibly* scuffed, it is very much work in progress.

## Usage

To convert, download the sources and parsers lists,
then pick the backup and save paths and hit convert.
